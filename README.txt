This program uses different synths and samples found in Sonic Pi in a series
of loops—or as Sonic Pi calls them, iterations—to create a piece with three
distinct parts that blend together with changes in tempo. The program 
particularly explores the additional parameters Sonic Pi provides, such as
release, cutoff, rate and finish, with simple synths and samples.
